# pylidartracker
Tracking with VelodyneHDL LIDAR in python

# Goals:
Open large PCAP files for preview, pre-processing/editing in terms of coordinate transformation, clipping, background subtraction, clustering and tracking
Saving project config files (could be called callibration files) that can be appled to the files from similar experimental setup through API or the GUI to speed up the analysis proccess
